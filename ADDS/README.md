## Summary

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: The Summary section needs to be expanded.

The purpose of this tool is to simplify the deployment of a specific set of firewall rules and filters that can significantly reduce the attack surface of Domain Controllers without impacting the functionality of Active Directory.

This tool provides a flexible and repeatable way to deploy a secure configuration in your environment within minutes.

[![](../Images/Badges/license-mit.png)](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/active-directory-firewall/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Design

### Key Design Decisions

- The tool has been tested on Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11, but it should work on all versions of Windows Server and Windows clients currently supported by Microsoft.
- The firewall rules are designed with the assumption that you can define the following groups of IP addresses or network ranges:
  - **Client network** (servers and client computers)
  - **Management network** (endpoints used for Tier 0 administration)
  - **Domain Controller network** (all DCs in your forest)
- These rules are specifically designed for Domain Controllers and not for servers or client machines. It is expected that the DCs are only running the recommended set of roles, such as ADDS, DNS, and NTP server. No other roles have been tested.
- The rules are intended for DCs configured with **static IP addresses**, as recommended by Microsoft.
- The rules do not include configuration for SCOM, Backup agents, Log agents (except WEF push configuration), or any other custom agents running on DCs.
- The configuration focuses solely on Firewall rules and **does not include IPSec rules** or DC hardening settings, except for disabling several multicast services like LLMNR or mDNS.
- The configuration enforces GPO firewall rules only, meaning that any **local configurations on individual DCs will be ignored** during firewall rule evaluation.
- Only **Inbound rules** are configured and enforced.
- The configuration does not differentiate between the Domain, Private, and Public firewall profiles to avoid potential DC unavailability in case of incorrect network type detection by NLA.
- Many services that typically use dynamic ports are configured with **static port numbers** by the tool. This allows for easier tracing and troubleshooting at the network level and simplifies rule configuration for network firewalls.

### Host-Based Firewall vs Network-Based Firewall

Most network administrators only configure network-based firewalls and turn off the [Windows Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/) on servers. Their reasoning is that they do not want to maintain duplicate sets of firewall rules and that Windows Firewall rule management is cumbersome and inflexible.

![The most common DC firewall configuration](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-off.png)

There are several security issues with this approach:

- As network-based firewalls only filter traffic between networks, they are incapable of blocking lateral movement inside of VLANs. Their functionality might further be degraded by poor network segmentation.
- The majority of network firewalls is incapable of differentiating between various RPC-based protocols, most of which use dynamic port numbers. The entire ephemeral TCP port range (49152-65535) is thus typically accessible on domain controllers from the entire corporate network, regardless of whether a particular port is used by the Netlogon service or for remote management of scheduled tasks.
- Network-based firewalls are commonly managed by dedicated teams, which might lack the required advanced Windows knowledge.

![RPC over named pipes traffic with SMBv3 encryption](../Images/Screenshots/wireshark-smb3.png)

The best-practice is thus to configure both the network-based firewall and host-based firewall. Internet traffic should additionally be filtered by proxy servers.

This paper only focuses on secure configuration of host-based firewalls, i.e., Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, on domain controllers. However, the [Inbound Firewall Rules Reference](#inbound-firewall-rules-reference) chapter might also serve as information source for configuring network-based firewalls.

### Need for Scripting

As the Windows Firewall does not provide the ability create named IP address sets, e.g., Management VLANs, manual (re)configuration of firewall rules and their source IP address ranges is cumbersome and error-prone. It is therefore recommended to use PowerShell scripts to manage Windows Firewall rules, which is what the `DCFWTool` does.

### Firewall Rule Merging

As mentioned in the [Key Design Decisions](#key-design-decisions) section, the set of rules is only prepared for DC-related roles and are is adjusted for various agents or non-standard roles running on a DC.  
If you need to add additional firewall rules for your environment (DC agents, SCCM management, etc.), it is recommended to create separate GPO and define all the custom rules there.  
Firewall rules, which are finally configured on a DC, are the outcome of all the rules merged from all the applied GPOs.  

> [!NOTE]
> Please keep in mind that this whitepaper only focuses on the firewall configuration. It is not a security baseline and it does not cover domain controller security hardening. You should have a separate and dedicated security baseline GPO applied to your DCs.

![GPO precedence](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-precedence-gpo.png)

### Identifying Management Traffic

#### The Good

With some protocols, it is quite obvious that they should only be available from management networks or jump servers. This is the case of the **[Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)](#remote-desktop---user-mode-tcp-in)** or **[Remote Event Log Management](#remote-event-log-management-rpc)**.

#### The Bad

There are several protocols that should primarily be used for remote system management, but some organizations also used them for client traffic.

One such example is the **[Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](#windows-remote-management-http-in)** protocol. Contrary to its name, it can not only be used by [Server Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/server-manager/server-manager) and [PowerShell Remoting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting), but also by source-initiated [Windows Event Collector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wec/windows-event-collector) subscriptions.
As a best-practice, domain controllers should not be used as event forwarding targets, especially not by workstations. AD domains, where this recommendation is not followed, must first be reconfigured, before the strict firewall rules are applied to domain controllers.

Another example would be **[Active Directory Web Services (ADWS)](#active-directory-web-services-tcp-in)**. It is rare, but not unimaginable, to see legitimate PowerShell scripts with the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet running on client machines. Such scripts would stop working if ADWS is simply blocked on domain controllers.
On the other hand, it is relatively easy to rewrite these scipts to use the built-in [DirectorySearcher](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher) class, which relies on the [LDAP](#active-directory-domain-controller---ldap-tcp-in) protocol instead of ADWS. The added value would be the removal of the [ActiveDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/) PowerShell module dependency.

If an organization still uses the standalone [Managed Service Accounts (MSAs)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009), application servers need ADWS connectivity for MSA enrollment using the [Install-ADServiceAccount](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/install-adserviceaccount) PowerShell cmdlet. Migration to [Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview), which do not depend on this cmdlet, is highly recommended.

#### The Ugly

Unfortunately, there are some protocols which are required by all Windows clients, but can also be (mis)used to perform administrative operations.

One would be highly tempted to limit the **[Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-drsr/f977faaa-673e-4f66-b9bf-48c640241d47)** traffic to domain controllers and thus block potential [DCSync](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1729) attacks. Unfortunately, this protocol is also used by Windows clients during user logon, specifically its [IDL_DRSCrackNames](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-drsr/9b4bfb44-6656-4404-bcc8-dc88111658b3) RPC call, so it cannot simply be blocked by an L3 firewall rule.
One solution to this problem would be the deployment of the open-source [RPC Firewall](https://github.com/zeronetworks/rpcfirewall) tool, which can selectively limit the scope of the dangerous [IDL_DRSGetNCChanges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-drsr/b63730ac-614c-431c-9501-28d6aca91894) operation. However, the project does not seem to be mature enough for production deployments. Its installation and configuration is cumbersome and requires deep understanding of the RPC protocol. Moreover, the binaries are not digitally signed, making them incompatible with some optional Windows security features, including [LSA Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection). As a result, the most common approach is to just monitor domain controllers for unexpected replication traffic. Many products in the Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) category are able to detect the DCSync attack, including [Microsoft Defender for Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/what-is) and [Netwrix Threat Manager](https://www.netwrix.com/threat_detection_software.html).

The protocol that causes the most confusion among network administrators is undeniably the **[Server Message Block (SMB)](#active-directory-domain-controller---samlsa-np-tcp-in)**. Although its primary use is for file and printer sharing, it can also be used for remote system management through various RPC-based protocols. Because the functionality of AD heavily depends on the `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON` file shares on domain controllers, the SMB protocol cannot simply be blocked on DCs. Deep packet inspection has also become less effective with the advent of SMBv3 encryption. Our approach to this issue is to [selectively block remote management over SMB named pipes](#rpc-filters).

Also worth mentioning is the **[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](#active-directory-domain-controller---ldap-tcp-in)**, which gives Active Directory its name. It can surely be used for administrative operations, e.g., privileged group membership changes, but at least it does not provide the capability to directly execute arbitrary code on DCs. And with a well-configured SIEM or an ITDR solution, modifications of sensitive AD objects can be detected almost in real-time.

### Firewall Rule Deduplication

Many of the built-in/predefined Windows Firewall rules are actually duplicates of each other, as they open the same ports, even though their names might suggest otherwise. For example, all of the following rules open port `135/TCP` for the `rpcss` service:

- RPC Endpoint Mapper (TCP, Incoming)
- Active Directory Domain Controller (RPC-EPMAP)
- Microsoft Key Distribution Service (RPC EPMAP)
- DFS Replication (RPC-EPMAP)
- File Replication (RPC-EPMAP)
- File Server Remote Management (DCOM-In)
- Remote Service Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Scheduled Tasks Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Event Monitor (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Volume Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Windows Defender Firewall Remote Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)
- DFS Management (DCOM-In)
- COM+ Remote Administration (DCOM-In)
- COM+ Network Access (DCOM-In)
- Performance Logs and Alerts (DCOM-In)

![Duplicate RPC Endpoint Mapper rules](../Images/Screenshots/duplicate-epmap-rules.png)

Similarly, all of these firewall rules open port `445/TCP` for `System`:

- File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)
- Active Directory Domain Controller - SAM/LSA (NP-TCP-In)
- Netlogon Service (NP-In)
- File Server Remote Management (SMB-In)
- DFS Management (SMB-In)
- Remote Event Log Management (NP-In)
- Remote Service Management (NP-In)

![Duplicate SMB rules](../Images/Screenshots/duplicate-smb-rules.png)

Moreover, both ports 135 and 445 need to be accessible by all Windows clients for Active Directory to function properly. To keep the configuration readable, it is reasonable to consolidate the redundant rules, and to create a single firewall rule for each static port number.

### Issues with Predefined Address Sets

#### Overview of Keywords

In addition to manually enumerating IP address ranges, the firewall rule scope configuration allows the use of predefined sets of computers, known as keywords.

![Predefined address sets (keywords) in Windows Firewall](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-predefined-sets.png){ width=300px }

These keywords are briefly described in the [MS-FASP: Firewall and Advanced Security Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fasp/d69ec3fe-8507-4524-bdcc-813cbb3bf85f) document. However, there is no public documentation available that explains how the keywords are defined and under what circumstances the corresponding IP addresses are updated.

#### Intranet

The *Intranet* keyword is based on the Subnet definition from Active Directory Sites and Services. However, our tests have shown that the corresponding firewall rule scopes are not re-evaluated after adding or deleting a subnet. Even multiple server reboots do not seem to resolve this issue. Due to this unreliability, we have decided not to use the *Intranet* keyword in any firewall rules.

![Subnets - The source for the Intranet keyword](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-keyword-intranet.png)

#### Internet

The *Internet* keyword is presumed to include anything not defined as the *Intranet* keyword. However, due to the unpredictable and undocumented behavior of the *Intranet* keyword, we have decided not to use the *Internet* keyword in any firewall rules as well.

#### DNS Servers

The *DNS Servers* keyword is functional and respects all DNS servers defined in the network adapter properties. If a new DNS server IP address is configured, a network adapter state change (disable/enable, server restart, etc.) is required for the corresponding firewall rules to be automatically updated.

![Network adapter DNS configuration](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-keyword-dns.png){ width=400px }

#### Additional Keywords

Additional keywords are available and although they seem to be mostly working, they are not relevant to inbound firewall rule configuration for Domain Controller:

- Local subnet
- DHCP servers
- WINS servers
- Default gateway
- Remote Corp Network
- PlayTo Renderers
- Captive Portal Addresses

### Avoiding Localized Rule Names

All of the built-in firewall rules are localized and displayed based on the OS language. However, this feature relies on RSAT being installed on the management computer. If RSAT is absent, the UI may show references to missing DLL files instead of the actual firewall rule display names.

![Localized rule names not displayed correctly](../Images/Screenshots/localization-issue.png){ width=300px }

To ensure consistent firewall rule name display regardless of RSAT or the OS locale, we have decided to use only English rule names.

### Firewall Profiles

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: This section needs to be expanded.

![Windows Firewall profiles](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-profiles.png){ width=400px }

### Infeasibility of Outbound Traffic Filtering

#### Reasons for Blocking Outbound Traffic

Generally speaking, outbound firewall rules on domain controllers might play an important role in blocking NTLM relay to workstations, preventing lateral movement, breaking malware C2 channels, and mitigating the risk of data breaches.

On the other hand, all of the [security standards we are familiar with](#security-standards-compliance) state that Windows Firewall should allow outbound connections by default. The [CIS benchmark](#center-for-internet-security-cis-benchmark) provides this rationale:

> Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.

Furthermore, our security research has shown that configuring a reliable allow list for outbound traffic using the built-in features of Windows is impractical. We have identified several challenges that make it difficult to implement such a list.

#### Services with User Impersonation

The following important Windows services initiate outbound connections, yet they locally impersonate the currently logged-on user, making it impossible to target them in service-specific Windows Firewall rules:

- Windows Update (wuauserv)
- Cryptographic Services (CryptSvc)
- Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)

To allow Windows Update to work, one would need to target the `svchost.exe` program in a firewall rule, thus allowing all services to connect to remote computers.

#### Scheduled Tasks with Custom Handlers

Some scheduled task actions are implemented using a custom DLL handler. As a result, the corresponding firewall rule would need to target the `taskhostw.exe` program, thus allowing all scheduled tasks to connect to remote computers.

![Scheduled task with a custom handler](../Images/Screenshots/scheduled-task-custom-handler.png)

#### Microsoft Defender for Identity

The [Network Name Resolution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/nnr-policy) and [Lateral Movement Path Detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/deploy/remote-calls-sam) capabilies of Microsoft Defender for Identity depend on the domain controllers being able to connect over the RDP (TCP port 3389), RPC (TCP port 135), NetBIOS (UDP port 137), and SMB (TCP port 445) protocols to all workstations. It would thus be impossible to fully mitigate NTLM relay attacks against domain controllers using outbound firewall rules in environments with this product deployed. Moreover, the sensor needs to be able to communicate with Microsoft's servers as well.

#### Azure Arc

Large organizations might want to utilize the new hotpatching capability of Windows Server 2025. However, this feature is only available on servers managed by [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc). And the Azure Arc Agent contains several binaries and PowerShell scripts, which all need to be able to communicate with Microsoft's cloud, but their exact behavior is undocumented and subject to change.

![Azure Arc Agent binaries and PowerShell scripts](../Images/Screenshots/azure-arc-binaries.png){ width=400px }

Interestingly, the Azure Arc installer creates a custom outbound firewall rule called `SmeOutboundOpenException`, which targets all processes and is scoped to a hardcoded list of Microsoft's IP addresses. It is unclear how reliable and future-proof this rule actually is, as even [Google has never heard of it](https://www.google.com/search?q=SmeOutboundOpenException).

![Azure Arc built-in outbound firewall rule](../Images/Screenshots/azure-arc-firewall.png){ width=400px }

#### Installers Downloading Additional Files

Many application installers (`setup.exe` or `setup.msi`) do not work in a fully offline mode, as they need to download some prerequisites from the Internet. Microsoft .NET Framework and Visual C++ Runtime seem to be the most common installer dependencies. Then there are so-called web installers, which download all application binaries from online sources. As installers do not have well-defined names and can be executed from any location, it is impossible to selectively cover them by a firewall rule.

#### Dynamic Keywords

Windows Firewall includes a functionality called [dynamic keywords](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/dynamic-keywords), which simplifies the management of Windows Firewall. This feature allows administrators to define the following types of keywords, which can then be referenced by firewall rules:

- Set of IP address ranges
- Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)
- Autoresolution options

As the dynamic keywords cannot be referenced in firewall rules managed by Group Policies, we have decided not to use them in our configuration.

#### WinHTTP Proxy

After we verified that it was indeed impossible selectively filter outbound Internet traffic on domain controllers using Windows Firewall in a reliable way, we turned our attention to the built-in [WinHTTP proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/netsh-exe-commands#set-advproxy). The idea was to compile a list of all cloud endpoints used by Windows Server components and to configure the local WinHTTP proxy to only allow outbound HTTP(S) connections to these endpoints, while acting as a black hole for any other outbound traffic.

![Listing the advanced WinHTTP proxy configuration](../Images/Screenshots/proxy-config.png)

Although this approach seemed promising initially, we soon stumbled upon a few difficulties: The advanced WinHTTP proxy settings lack proper documentation and the ever-changing list of Microsoft's cloud services used by Windows Server turned out to be too large for us to maintain. And when the `netsh.exe winhttp reset autoproxy` stopped working repeatedly and manual registry cleanup was necessary to fix this issue, we definitely abandoned the idea of using WinHTTP proxy on domain controllers.

![WinHTTP proxy configuration error](../Images/Screenshots/proxy-error.png)

#### Escaping the Rabbit Hole

As a conclusion, the only viable and secure solution is to deploy 3rd-party Internet proxy servers that would limit the outbound traffic from domain controllers to select FQDNs. This list of approved addresses used by Microsoft's services should ideally be kept up-to-date by the proxy vendor.

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Network protection, Telemetry, Windows Update P2P

And then there are of course air-gapped (isolated) environments, in which the growing number of cloud-dependent Windows Server features will never be used, thus eliminating the need to differentiate between legitimate and potentially malitious Internet traffic.

### Static RPC Ports

Several Windows services that use RPC dynamic ports by default can be configured to listen on static port numbers instead. This allows for easier tracing and troubleshooting at the network level and simplifies rule configuration for network-based firewalls.

The following services are supported by our solution:

### RPC Filters

#### RPC over Named Pipes

Most RPC protocols implemented in Windows support two transport types:

- [RPC over TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rpce/95fbfb56-d67a-47df-900c-e263d6031f22)
- [RPC over SMB Named Pipes (ncacn_np)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rpce/7063c7bd-b48b-42e7-9154-3c2ec4113c0d)

Each Windows service which uses the TCP/IP transport is assigned its own RPC dynamic port and in some cases, [static ports can be configured](#static-rpc-ports). Windows Firewall rules can then target services by their identifiers or program paths and either allow or block service-specific inbound traffic. It is thus possible to only allow remote management traffic from specific IP addresses.

The named pipes transport is more problematic, as standard Windows Firewall rules can only allow or block all SMB traffic (`445/TCP`) and Active Directory functionality heavily depends on the `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON` file shares being available over the SMB protocol to all Windows clients. The SMB protocol is therefore very popular among malicious actors and many off-the-shelf hacktools exclusively use the named pipes to perform remote code execution and other undesirable operations.

Fortunately, it is possible to use the RPC Filters, a lesser known feature of the Windows Firewall, to partially limit undesirable RPC traffic. There is no graphical user interface for RPC Filters, but a subset of their capabilities can be configured using the `netsh.exe` tool. Each RPC protocol must be dealt with individually.

#### \[MS-SCMR\]: Service Control Manager Remote Protocol

The [\[MS-SCMR\]: Service Control Manager Remote Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-scmr/705b624a-13de-43cc-b8a2-99573da3635f) with UUID [367ABB81-9844-35F1-AD32-98F038001003](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-scmr/e7a38186-cde2-40ad-90c7-650822bd6333) is used by the built-in `services.msc` console and the `sc.exe` utility to remotely manage Windows services:

```shell
sc.exe \\dc01 query wuauserv
```

```txt
SERVICE_NAME: wuauserv
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS

        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
```

While the built-in Windows tools use the TCP/IP transport, hacktools commonly utilize the [\\PIPE\\svcctl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-scmr/e7a38186-cde2-40ad-90c7-650822bd6333) SMB named pipe to execute code on remote systems:

#### \[MS-TSCH\]: Task Scheduler Service Remoting Protocol

The [\[MS-TSCH\]: Task Scheduler Service Remoting Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsch/d1058a28-7e02-4948-8b8d-4a347fa64931) with UUID [86D35949-83C9-4044-B424-DB363231FD0C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsch/fbab083e-f79f-4216-af4c-d5104a913d40) is used by the built-in `taskschd.msc` console and the `schtasks.exe` utility to remotely manage scheduled tasks:

```shell

While the built-in Windows tools use the TCP/IP transport, hacktools commonly utilize the [\\PIPE\\atsvc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsch/fbab083e-f79f-4216-af4c-d5104a913d40) SMB named pipe to execute code on remote systems:

The following sequence of `netsh.exe` commands will block MS-TSCH connections over named pipes, while still allowing the TCP/IP traffic used by legitimate tools:

```txt

#### \[MS-EVEN6\]: EventLog Remoting Protocol Version 6.0

The [\[MS-EVEN6\]: EventLog Remoting Protocol Version 6.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-even6/18000371-ae6d-45f7-95f3-249cbe2be39b) with UUID [F6BEAFF7-1E19-4FBB-9F8F-B89E2018337C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-even6/3479d837-b759-4b13-9d5e-4c93eede7cb6) is used by the built-in `eventvwr.msc` console and the `wevtutil.exe` command line tool to remotely query and manage Windows event logs:

```shell
wevtutil.exe /r:dc01 qe Security /c:1 /f:text
```

Malicious actors might use this protocol to clear security event logs remotely and thus cover their tracks. The following sequence of `netsh.exe` commands will block MS-EVEN6 connections over named pipes, while still allowing the TCP/IP traffic used by legitimate tools:

```txt

The protocol is only exposed over the `\PIPE\eventlog` named pipe and might be abused by malicious actors to initiate NTLM relay attacks:

```shell

The primary solution to this vulnerability, commonly known as PrinterBug, is to disable the `Print Spooler` service on domain controllers. As an alternative, the following sequence of `netsh.exe` commands will block MS-RPRN connections over named pipes:

```txt
rpc filter

```

> [!NOTE]
> In a future version of Windows Server, the MS-RPRN protocol will exclusively be [moved to a standalone TCP port](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/printing/windows-11-rpc-connection-updates-for-print) by default.

#### \[MS-EFSR\]: Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC) Protocol

The [\[MS-EFSR\]: Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC) Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/08796ba8-01c8-4872-9221-1000ec2eff31) is [available over multiple named pipes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/1baaad2f-7a84-4238-b113-f32827a39cd2):

In environments where EFS is not used, the MS-EFSR protocol could be disabled entirely. A more compatible approach would be to enforce Kerberos authentication and packet encryption on MS-EFSR connections. Although this solution is not bulletproof, it works against most hacktools. Here is the corresponding sequence of `netsh.exe` commands:

#### \[MS-DNSP\]: Domain Name Service (DNS) Server Management Protocol

The [\[MS-DNSP\]: Domain Name Service (DNS) Server Management Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/f97756c9-3783-428b-9451-b376f877319a) with UUID [50ABC2A4-574D-40B3-9D66-EE4FD5FBA076](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/5093503c-687e-4376-9127-50504908fb91) is used by the built-in `dnsmgmt.msc` console and the `dnscmd.exe` utility to remotely manage DNS servers:

```shell
dnscmd.exe dc01 /EnumZones /Primary /Forward
```

```txt
Enumerated zone list:
        Zone count = 3

 Zone name                      Type       Storage         Properties
 _msdcs.contoso.com             Primary    AD-Forest       Secure
 contoso.com                    Primary    AD-Domain
 TrustAnchors                   Primary    AD-Forest

Command completed successfully.
```

The [ServerLevelPluginDll](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/9500a7e8-165d-4b13-be86-0ddc43100eef) operation of the `MS-DNSP` protocol can be misused to remotely execute code on domain controllers, which makes this protocol interesting from the attacker's perspective. Although the built-in Windows tools only use the TCP/IP transport, the protocol is exposed over the `\PIPE\DNSSERVER` named pipe as well. The latter transport layer could be blocked by executing the following sequence of `netsh.exe` commands:

```txt
rpc filter
add rule layer=um actiontype=block filterkey=50754fe4-aa2d-42ff-8196-e90ea8fd2527
add condition field=protocol matchtype=equal data=ncacn_np
add condition field=if_uuid matchtype=equal data=50abc2a4-574d-40b3-9d66-ee4fd5fba076
add filter
```

#### \[MS-WMI\]: Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol

The [\[MS-WMI\]: Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-wmi/c476597d-4c76-47e7-a2a4-a564fe4bf814) protocol is often used by administrators for remote system administration and monitoring:

```powershell
(Get-WmiObject -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName dc01 -Property Caption).Caption
```

```txt
Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Standard
```

The protocol is also popular among malicious actors to perform remote command execution:

```shell
impacket-wmiexec 'contoso/Admin:Pa$$w0rd@dc01' hostname
```

```txt
Impacket v0.11.0 - Copyright 2023 Fortra

[*] SMBv3.0 dialect used
DC01
```

Although the output of the tool might suggest that WMI traffic can be tunnelled through SMB named pipes as well, it is fortunately not true and the WMI protocol can effectively be blocked using Windows Firewall. To further mitigate the threat of remote malicious command execution over WMI, it is recommended to turn on the following [Microsoft Defender Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction) rules:

- [Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands)
- [Block persistence through WMI event subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-persistence-through-wmi-event-subscription)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) agent will not work properly if these ASR rules are enabled.

#### Malicious C2 Protocols and Backdoors

Some malicious tools can use the RPC protocol as a Command and Control (C2) channel. One such example is the infamous `Mimikatz` tool, which can be remotely controlled through the MimiCom interface with UUID [17FC11E9-C258-4B8D-8D07-2F4125156244](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/master/mimicom.idl). One could of course block this interface using the following RPC filter:

```txt
rpc filter
add rule layer=um actiontype=block filterkey=644291ca-9530-4066-b654-e7b838ebdc06
add condition field=if_uuid matchtype=equal data=17FC11E9-C258-4B8D-8D07-2F4125156244
add filter
```

Unfortunately, this approach would be futile, as serious adversaries would never use a well-known protocol identifier.

#### Further Protocol Considerations

The following protocols need to be investigated in the future, as they are open to all domain controller clients:

- [\[MS-TSTS\]: Terminal Services Terminal Server Runtime Interface Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsts/1eb45af1-94f1-4c42-9e13-dd0a018646fd)
- [\[MS-RSP\]: Remote Shutdown Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rsp/6dfeb978-7a02-4826-b537-a1760fbf8074)
- [\[MS-DCOM\]: Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dcom/4a893f3d-bd29-48cd-9f43-d9777a4415b0), specifically the ShellWindows, ShellBrowserWindow, and MMC20 objects.
- [\[MS-RRP\]: Windows Remote Registry Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rrp/0fa3191d-bb79-490a-81bd-54c2601b7a78)

## Group Policy Object Contents

![Managed GPO contents](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-contents.png)

### Firewall Configuration

Based on the configured options in `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` [configuration file](#configuration-file), the GPO will contain Windows Firewall profile settings:  

- [Log dropped packets](#logdroppedpackets)
- [Log allowed packets](#logallowedpackets)
- [Log file location](#logfilepath)
- [Maximum log size](#logmaxsizekilobytes)
- [Enable local IPSec rule merge](#enablelocalipsecrules)

![GPO firewall configuration](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-firewall-config.png)

### Inbound Firewall Rules

Based on the configured options in `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` [configuration file](#configuration-file), the GPO will contain set of inbound [firewall rules](#inbound-firewall-rules-reference).

![GPO inbound firewall rules](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-firewall-inbound-rules.png)

### Registry Settings

Based on the configured options in `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` [configuration file](#configuration-file), the GPO will contain number of registry settings.  
Most of them are managed, which means, once the GPO is not linked to the target, the settings revert back to the default state.  
Some of them are [unmanaged](#dealing-with-gpo-tattooing) though and need different approach, when you require reverting back to default.

![GPO registry settings](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-registry.png)

### Administrative Templates

The following ADMX and their respective ADML (in English) are copied to Central Store if it exists:

`DomainControllerFirewall.admx`

- Contains template for configuration of the following settings:
  - [NTDS Static Port](#ntdsstaticport)  
  Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → RPC Static Ports → Domain Controller: Active Directory RPC static port
  - [Netlogon Static Port](#netlogonstaticport)  
  Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → RPC Static Ports → Domain Controller: Netlogon static port
  - [FRS Static Port](#frsstaticport)  
  Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → RPC Static Ports → Domain Controller: File Replication Service (FRS) static port
  - [mDNS Configuration](#disablemdns)  
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Network → DNS Client → Turn off Multicast DNS (mDNS) client

`MSS-legacy.admx`

- Contains template for configuration of all the settings stored in:  
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → MSS (Legacy)

`SecGuide.admx`

- Contains template for configuration of all the settings stored in:  
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → MS Security Guide

### Startup Script

Startup script is used to configure some of the required settings, that are not easily configurable through Group Policy.  
`FirewallConfiguration.bat` script, is automatically generated, based on the configuration defined in the `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` file.
If enabled in the .json file, the script will execute the following actions:

- Configure WMI static port
- Installs DFS Management tools, if not already present on the machine
- Configure DFSR static port
- Creates firewall log and sets the permissions on it
- Registers RPC filters, defined in `RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt`

> Due to the [GPO foreground processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj573586(v=ws.11)) requirement, when applying a startup script, the server needs to be restarted to apply the configuration items in the script.

#### WMI static port

The script will move the WMI service to a standalone process listening on TCP port 24158 with authentication level set to RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY.

```bat
winmgmt.exe /standalonehost 6
```

#### DFSR static port

If the server doesn't have DFS Management tools installed, the script will istall it.

```bat
if not exist "%SystemRoot%\system32\dfsrdiag.exe" (
  dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DfsMgmt
)
```

Next, it will configure the DFSR to use static port.

```bat
dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:5722
```

#### Firewall Log File

![Firewall log file configuration](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-log-config.png){ width=400px }

Log file is not created by the GPO, ACLs need to be configured through command line.

```bat
netsh.exe advfirewall set allprofiles logging filename "%systemroot%\system32\logfiles\firewall\pfirewall.log"
```

#### RPC Filters Script

![RPC Filters configuration file](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-rpcnamedpipesfilter.png)  

The script will register all RPC filters defined in `RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt` file, which is located in the same path as the `FirewallConfiguration.bat`, in the "Startup" folder under the recently created firewall GPO.

```bat
netsh.exe -f "\\contoso.com\SysVol\contoso.com\Policies\{37CB7204-5767-4AA7-8E85-D29FEBDFF6D6}\Machine\Scripts\Startup\RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt"
```

### NPS Fix for Downlevel Windows Servers

Windows Server 2016 and 2019

[EnableNPS](#enablenps)

```bat
sc.exe sidtype IAS unrestricted
```

#### Sample Startup Script

```shell
@ECHO OFF
REM This script is managed by the Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 PowerShell script.

echo Move the WMI service to a standalone process listening on TCP port 24158 with authentication level set to RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY.
winmgmt.exe /standalonehost 6

echo Install the dfsrdiag.exe tool if absent.
if not exist "%SystemRoot%\system32\dfsrdiag.exe" (
    dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DfsMgmt
)

echo Set static RPC port for DFS Replication.
dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:5722

echo Create the firewall log file and configure its DACL.
netsh.exe advfirewall set allprofiles logging filename "%systemroot%\system32\logfiles\firewall\pfirewall.log"

echo Register the RPC filters.
netsh.exe -f "%~dp0RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt"

echo Fix the NPS service to work with Windows Firewall on downlevel Windows Server versions.
sc.exe sidtype IAS unrestricted
```

## Configuration

### Configuration File

All settings that are used for the deployment by the script need to be stored in the file named `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json`.  
The file does not exist by default and needs to be created by you, before deployment.  
To help you with the task, we're providing the 2 following files:  

- `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Starter.json`
- `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Sample.json`  

`Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Starter.json` file contains only the minimum settings required for deployment. It is recommended to rename the file to `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` and add any additional settings you want to be configured during the deployment.

`Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Sample.json` contains all possible configuration items, with sample values.
It is essential to properly configure all the settings, do not use the samples for production deployment without thorough review and adjustment.

> [!CAUTION]
> Improper configuration can cause network outages in your environment!

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: true
Recommended value: false
Possible values: true / false
```

### EnablePrintSpooler

Indicates whether inbound Print Spooler traffic through RPC over TCP should be allowed.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: true
Recommended value: false
Possible values: true / false
```

### EnableNetworkProtection

Indicates whether the [Network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection?view=o365-worldwide#overview-of-network-protection) feature of Microsoft Defender Antivirus should be enabled.

If `true` MDA Network Protection will be configured in block mode. If `false` MDA Network Protection will be configured in audit mode only. If `null` MDA Network Protection will not be configured.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: null
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false / null
```

### BlockWmiCommandExecution

Indicates whether to block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands using Defender ASR. This is achieved by enforcing the following Microsoft Defender Antivirus Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules:

- [Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands)
- [Block persistence through WMI event subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-persistence-through-wmi-event-subscription)

If `true` MDA Attack Surface Reduction rules (mentioned above) will be configured in block mode. If `false` MDA Attack Surface Reduction rules (mentioned above) will be configured in audit mode only, allowing you to evaluate the possible impact if the rules were enabled in block mode. If `null` MDA ASR rules are not configured, effectively disabling the rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) agent will not work properly if these ASR rules are enabled.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: null
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false / null
```

### EnableRpcFilters

Indicates whether additional [filtering of RPC over Named Pipes](#rpc-filters) should be applied.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: null
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false / null
```

### EnableLocalIPsecRules

Indicates whether local IPSec rules should be enabled. Although no IPSec rules are deployed by this solution, most [security baselines](#security-standards-compliance) require local IPSec rules to be disabled.

If `true`, local IPSec rules will be enabled. If `false`, only IPSec rules distributed through GPOs will be allowed.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: true
Recommended value: false
Possible values: true / false
```

### CustomRuleFileNames

Specifies the name(s) of additional script file(s) containing firewall rules that will be imported into the Group Policy Object (GPO).

There are several practical advantages to keeping customer-specific firewall rules in separate files:

- The main script file can easily be updated without the need to re-apply customer modifications.
- Custom rule scripts can be shared among multiple server roles. As an example, rules enabling communication with a backup agent will probably be the same for domain controller (DC) and certification authority (CA).

See the `CustomRules.Sample.ps1` sample file, which can be used as a template.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Required: false
Default value: null
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

![](../Images/Badges/windows-server.png) ![](../Images/Badges/windows-client.png)

![](../Images/Badges/powershell5.png)

- Domain Admins group membership or equivalent privileges, enabling the creation of a Group Policy Object (GPO), creation of folders and files in `SYSVOL`, and linking the GPO to the Domain Controllers OU.
- PowerShell modules that must be installed as part of RSAT:
  - [GroupPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)
  - [ActiveDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)

### Dealing with GPO Tattooing

Some firewall-related settings are not removed from the domain controllers after they fall out of scope of the GPO. These changes are thus permanent and require manual removal. Such settings are called **unmanaged** and the resulting behavior is known as GPO tattooing. To address this issue, configuration files use ternary logic:

- `true` ⇒ The setting is enabled by the GPO.
- `false` ⇒ The setting is disabled by the GPO.
- `null` ⇒ The local setting is not changed by the GPO.

As a consequence, before the value of an unmanaged setting can be changed from `true` to `null`, it must temporarily be set to `false`.  Keep in mind that it may take time for the new settings to propagate to all domain controllers due to replication latency. Additionally, some settings may require a reboot.

The following settings in this project are known to cause tattooing:

- [NtdsStaticPort](#ntdsstaticport)
- [NetlogonStaticPort](#netlogonstaticport)
- [FrsStaticPort](#frsstaticport)
- [DfsrStaticPort](#dfsrstaticport)
- [WmiStaticPort](#wmistaticport)
- [DisableNetbiosBroadcasts](#disablenetbiosbroadcasts)
- [DisableMDNS](#disablemdns)
- [EnableRpcFilters](#enablerpcfilters)

### System Reboots

Changes to some settings require a reboot of the target domain controller to get applied. This is the case of static port number configurations and settings that are modified through the startup script:

- [NtdsStaticPort](#ntdsstaticport)
- [NetlogonStaticPort](#netlogonstaticport)
- [FrsStaticPort](#frsstaticport)
- [DfsrStaticPort](#dfsrstaticport)
- [WmiStaticPort](#wmistaticport)
- [EnableRpcFilters](#enablerpcfilters)
- [LogFilePath](#logfilepath)
- [EnableNPS](#enablenps)

If a full system reboot of all domain controllers is undesirable, the following steps can be performed instead:

1. Make sure that the Group Policy changes are replicated to all domain controllers.
2. Invoke the `gpupdate.exe` command for the changed policies to be applied immediately.
3. Run the `gpscript.exe /startup` command for Group Policy startup scripts to be executed immediately.
4. Execute the `net.exe stop NTDS && net.exe start NTDS` command to restart the AD DS Domain Controller service.
5. Execute the `net.exe stop IAS && net.exe start IAS` command to restart the Network Policy Server service, if present.
6. Execute the `net.exe stop NtFrs && net.exe start NtFrs` command to restart the File Replication service, if migration to DFS-R has not been performed yet.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 on all domain controllers.

### Installation

Rename `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Starter.json` to `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json`.  
Review the available configuration items with sample values in `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Sample.json` and use any, that you want to be configured in your environment.  
All the configuration items with their possible values are documented in the [Configuration](#configuration) chapter.

Once you are finished with modifying all the required configuration settings in the `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` file, it is recommended to review the [set of rules](#inbound-firewall-rules-reference) that will be deployed by the GPO.  

After the review is completed, you can begin with the deployment.

Open Powershell and run the `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1` script:

![Executing the PowerShell script](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-install-script.png)

You might need to adjust your Powershell execution policy to allow execution of the script:

![Changing the Script Execution Policy](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-ps-exec-policy.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using AppLocker, Device Guard or Constrained Language Mode, you might need adjust the configured restrictions in order to run the script.  

Script logic:

Creates GPO – the GPO is NOT linked to any OU.

Atomic changes…

Creates startup script `FirewallConfiguration.bat` (batch file is used to avoid any issues with Powershell execution policy)

![Autogenerated Group Policy startup script](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-gpo-startup-script.png)

If the script has finished without any errors, all required objects should be deployed.

The last step is to link the newly created GPO to Domain Controllers OU.

Before doing that, you should **thoroughly review** the GPO!  

Once done, link the GPO to Domain Controllers OU.

![Group Policy link](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-gpo-link.png)

By default, GPO is refreshed every 5 minutes for DCs, so all your DCs should have the firewall configuration applied within maximum of 5 minutes.  
Some settings require DC restart to apply, please refer to [System Reboots](#system-reboots).

### Troubleshooting

The following PowerShell script can be used to display the Windows Firewall log file in a human-readable way:

```powershell
[string] $logFilePath = "$env:SystemRoot\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log"

[string[]] $columnsToShow = @('date','time','path','action','pid',
    'src-ip','src-port','dst-ip','dst-port','icmptype','icmpcode')

Get-Content -Path $LogFilePath |
    Select-Object -Skip 3 |
    ForEach-Object { $PSItem -replace '^#Fields: ' } |
    ConvertFrom-Csv -Delimiter ' ' |
    Select-Object -Property $columnsToShow |
    Out-GridView -Title 'Windows Firewall Log' -Wait
```

![Parsing firewall log files](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-log-parser.png){ width=400px }

An improved version of this script is available in the `Show-WindowsFirewallLog.ps1` file, which is part of the `DCFWTool`.

### Rollback

As some of the settings are propagated throug startup script and some, even though propagated through GPO, cause tattooing, you first need to reconfigure some settings in the GPO and modify the startup script, let the changes apply on all DCs and only after that, unlink the GPO.

Follow these steps:

1. Change the following settings in the GPO:

- [NtdsStaticPort](#ntdsstaticport)
- [NetlogonStaticPort](#netlogonstaticport)
- [FrsStaticPort](#frsstaticport)
- [DisableNetbiosBroadcasts](#disablenetbiosbroadcasts)
- [DisableMDNS](#disablemdns)

[Locate](#administrative-templates) all the above settings in the Firewall GPO and set them to "Not Configured".

![Rollback GPO Tattooing](../Images/Screenshots/rollback-gpo-tatto.png)

2. Change the following settings in the startup script:

- [DfsrStaticPort](#dfsrstaticport)
- [WmiStaticPort](#wmistaticport)

Locate and open `FirewallConfiguration.bat` file, located in the "Startup" folder of the DC firewall GPO (e.g.: `C:\Windows\Sysvol\domain\Policies\{03AAF463-967E-46DD-AB7F-DBD4ECC28F63}\Machine\Scripts\Startup`):

> [!NOTE]
> The GUID in the path is randomly generated and will be different in each environment. Also the path to `SYSVOL` might differ based on your DC configuration.

Change the following line `winmgmt.exe /standalonehost 6` ⇒ `winmgmt /sharedhost`  
Change the following line `dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:5722` ⇒ `dfsrdiag staticrpc /port:0`

![Rollback Startup Script](../Images/Screenshots/rollback-startup-script.png)

3. Remove the RPC filters

Remove "#" before "exit" at line 15 in `RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt`, located in the "Startup" folder of the DC firewall GPO (e.g.: `C:\Windows\Sysvol\domain\Policies\{03AAF463-967E-46DD-AB7F-DBD4ECC28F63}\Machine\Scripts\Startup`):

> [!NOTE]
> The GUID in the path is randomly generated and will be different in each environment. Also the path to `SYSVOL` might differ based on your DC configuration.

![Rollback RPC Named Pipes](../Images/Screenshots/rollback-rpc-named-pipes.png)

4. Restart the DCs

Once AD and `SYSVOL` replication convergence is achieved and all DCs in the environment received the changed GPO, startup script and RPC configuration file, you need to restart all DCs.

5. Unlink the GPO

Once all DCs have been restarted, you unlink the Firewall GPO from the Domain Controllers container in GPO management console.

### Additional Server Roles and Features

#### Server Role Co-Location

As a security best-practice, it is recommended not to deploy additional server roles on domain controller servers. Unfortunately, real-world environments do not always follow this recommendation and domain controllers often serve as branch office DHCP and RADIUS servers as well. This chapter therefore contains a list of optional firewall rules that can be enabled to support such scenarios.

For now, the following Windows Server roles and features are covered:

- [Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)](#windows-internet-naming-service-wins-tcp-in)
- [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server](#dhcp-server-v4-udp-in)
- [Network Policy Server (NPS)](#network-policy-server-legacy-radius-authentication---udp-in)

- [Windows Deployment Services (WDS)](#windows-deployment-services-rpc-in)
- [Key Management Service (KMS)](#key-management-service-tcp-in)
- [File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)](#remote-file-server-resource-manager-management---fsrm-reports-service-rpc-in)
- [Print Spooler](#file-and-printer-sharing-spooler-service---rpc) (highly discouraged)
- [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](#windows-server-update-services-http-in)
- [OpenSSH SSH Server](#openssh-ssh-server-sshd)
